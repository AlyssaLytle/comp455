# Homework

## How It Works

The exams in this course are made entirely from these homework problems! 

### Policy starting from HW2

We will not be providing solutions for HW2+, but you can work with your classmates, attend office hours, and use any outside tools you'd like to find solutions! 

If you post a *unique*, readable, acceptable solution to Edstem, you will get 5 percentage points extra credit on the final exam! **Limit to one per student!** (Note that your solution must be unique, so if someone has already shared the same/a very similar solution you will not get credit.)
