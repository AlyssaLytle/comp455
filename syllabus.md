## Course Description

The goal of this course is to help students improve their knowledge and skills in the field of
theory of computation. In particular, students will learn about various models of computation,
mathematically analyze their behavior, and explore the limits of computation. Students
will also become familiar with core concepts in complexity theory, including reducibility, time
complexity, and space complexity.

## Grading

1. Homework (0%): Homework will not be apart of your grade for this course. However, problem sets will be released periodically, and from these problem sets the quiz and final exam questions will be chosen. You can have these assignments graded for you with feedback by submitting them to Gradescope. 

2. Lessons (10%): There will be multiple choice Gradescope assignments throughout the semester to assess your understanding of the material.

2. Quizzes (60%): There will be three in-person, handwritten quizzes throughout the semester.

3. Final Exam (30%): The final exam will be in-person and handwritten.

### Quiz Absence Policy

You may be absent for up to one quiz.

Being absent from a quiz results in the quiz’s credit being drawn down from your final exam score’s weight. As such, this is not a penalty; your mastery of this quiz’ material will be assessed on the cumulative final exam.

If, and only if, you take all quizzes and your final examination score exceeds your lowest quiz score, then we will retroactively grant you an absence for the lowest quiz score and your final exam score will be worth 50%.
