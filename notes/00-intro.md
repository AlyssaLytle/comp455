# Course Introduction: Some Context

## What is this class about?

- In this class you will be learning about the fundamental mathematical properties of computers.
- These concepts were largely invented *before* the computer itself. 
- It started as a goal to *formalize* mathematical problems.

## Three Big Focuses in Computing

- Automata, Computability, and Complexity

### Automata

- Can we mathematically define models of computation?
- Can we mathematically define a *"computer"*?

### Computability

- Is this problem solvable or is it not?

### Complexity

- What makes some problems computationally "hard" and computationally "easy"?

- Can we formalize different difficulty levels?

## Goals for this Course

- Work through the mathematical representations used to develop modern computers

- Develop more advanced language to describe problems and solutions (algorithms)
